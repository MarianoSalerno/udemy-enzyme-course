This is the implementation I made for the [Udemy React testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://toptal.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/) course. It is a React implementation of the [Jotto game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto) where you guess a secret word picked using a provided [random word server](https://github.com/flyrightsister/udemy-react-testing-projects/tree/master/random-word-server). 

The project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the implementation uses hooks and contexts, with the course focusing on explaining how to test them in different ways using enzyme's `mount` and `shallow` functions. There is also a Redux part but I skipped it because we do not use it, I'll try to tackle it in the future
